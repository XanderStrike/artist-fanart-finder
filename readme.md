# Artist Fanart Finder

A simple script for downloading fanart for artists.

### Usage 

Run it like this:

    ./fanart.rb /home/xander/music

The script will create a file called `fanart.png` or `fanart.jpg` in each artist folder.

Your music must be organized into artist folders. If it isn't, shame on you. You can use something like [beets](http://beets.radbox.org/) to clean up your act.

Check `config.rb` for configuration options.

### Todo

* Add support for [Home Theater Backdrops](http://www.htbackdrops.org/v2/index.php) for higher resolution fanart.
